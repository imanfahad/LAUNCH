            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>Only a few users had access to a NeXT computer platform on which the first browser ran, but development soon started on a simpler,<a href="">‘line-mode’ browser</a> , which could run on any system. It was written by Nicola Pellow during her student work placement at CERN.</p>

            <h2>My Present</h2>
            <p>This software ran in the X Window System environment, popular in the research community, and offered friendly window-based interaction. Shortly afterwards the NCSA released versions also for the PC and Macintosh environments. The existence of reliable user-friendly browsers on these popular computers had an immediate impact on the spread of the WWW.</p>

            <h2>My Future</h2>
            <p>The WWW design allowed easy access to existing information and an early web page linked to information useful to CERN scientists (e.g. the CERN phone book and guides for using CERN’s central computers). A search facility relied on keywords - there were no search engines in the early years.</p>
